# Titanic_Survivability_Prediction
Given the data regarding the passengers onboard the Titanic, this project aims to build a predictive model that aims to answer - "what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

# train.csv 
Contains the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.

# test.csv 
Contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger.

Using the patterns found in the train.csv data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in test.csv) survived.

Note: This project is part of the Kaggle Competitions.
